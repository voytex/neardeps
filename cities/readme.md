In the future, other cities may be added. Simply add folder called after the city and place all GTFS *.txt files in there. Restart Python server and send request with header `city=<new_city>`.

Regarding Czech cities -- it appears that Brno is kind of an exception. Other cities do not provide pure GTFS data to public sadly.
